# Starts streaming to $NIGHTCALL_SINK_HOSTNAME.
# The first microphone of the second card (alsa://plughw:1,0) will be streamed.
# Override this by setting $NIGHTCALL_SOURCE_URL to something VLC can play.
#

# Configuration
# =============
# First play some test things to show we are ready
# Stream $NIGHTCALL_SOURCE_URL to $NIGHTCALL_SINK_HOSTNAME or default to
# streaming first microphone of second card (plughw:1,0)
NIGHTCALL_SOURCE_URL=${NIGHTCALL_SOURCE_URL:-alsa://plughw:1,0}
# A wav file to play to the other end as a means of checking whether it
# works.
NIGHTCALL_READY_SOURCE_URL=${NIGHTCALL_READY_SOURCE_URL:-/home/pi/nightcall/beep.wav}
# Other end of connection, defaults to zenzi.local.
# pulseaudio cookie will be loaded from there for authentication.
# Also this will be the target of playing the built-in microphone
NIGHTCALL_SINK_HOSTNAME=${NIGHTCALL_SINK_HOSTNAME:-zenzi.local}
# ============

# Be sure to load env variables since this might be invoked from
# systemd which apparently has its own set of environment variables.
